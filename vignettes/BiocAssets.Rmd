# Status dashboard

See [the dev.status board](https://dev.status.bioconductor.org)

The sources for this are [in github](https://github.com/bioconductor/status.bioconductor.org)

The key action for establishing status is [here](https://github.com/Bioconductor/status.bioconductor.org/blob/main/.github/workflows/checks.yaml)

This is all derived from cstate monitoring template.

## Possible to-dos

- verify that a container can run its binaries
- randomized approach
- check last date of build
- source check, check bioconductor.org and cloudfront
- BiocManager checking

# Container production

## Production
Main action for container production is in [github](https://github.com/bioconductor/bioconductor_docker)

Bottom up view

basic [action](https://github.com/Bioconductor/bioconductor_docker/blob/devel/.github/workflows/build_containers.yaml)

## Verification of products

use docker pull and Rscript 

Note that tag generation does execute the container and some functionality within

In devel there was a mismatch to "release"+.1

## Documentation
### To-dos 
- renovate https://bioconductor.org/help/docker/ to improve scope of coverage
