# Overview

As of 2024, Bioconductor containers are all ubuntu-based, following
the lead of the [rocker project](https://rocker-project.org/).

In general, compilation of packages to be used within such containers
needs to happen only once; the binary package can be lodged in a
web-accessible repository.  Installation consists of retrieval,
decompression, copying.

This document details the method for producing and distributing
binary packages for Bioconductor.  This document does not
address production of debian packages in the bioc2u project.
